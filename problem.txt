Design a vaccination appointment booking system with the following assumptions and
features:
Assumptions:
● Vaccination centers are scattered across multiple states and districts.
● Each district can have multiple vaccination centers, and each center is uniquely
identifiable.
● Appointments are booked for a single day (24-hour duration).
● Each day has a maximum capacity of appointments per vaccination center.
● Citizens can book an appointment only once per vaccination dose.
● Cancellation is allowed for an appointment.
● Users below 18 years of age are not eligible for vaccination or using the system.

Features:
● Register a user with a unique identification number.
● Onboard a vaccination center with attributes such as state, district, and center ID.
● Add capacity to a vaccination center for a specific day.
● List all vaccination centers with day and capacity details for a given district.
● Allow users to book a vaccination center in their district on a specific day, subject to
availability.
● List all bookings made for a particular vaccination center on a given day.
● Allow users to cancel their existing bookings, freeing up the slot for others.
● Enable users to search for vaccination centers available in their current district.


Commands:

Example: ADD_VACCINATION_CENTER Karnataka Bangalore VC123
● ADD_CAPACITY <center_id> <day> <capacity>

● LIST_VACCINATION_CENTERS <district_name>
Example: LIST_VACCINATION_CENTERS Bangalore
● BOOK_VACCINATION <center_id> <day> <user_id>
Example: BOOK_VACCINATION VC123 5 U123
